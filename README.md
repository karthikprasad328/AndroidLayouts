# AndroidLayouts
Explored uses of linear layout, relative layout, grid layout, and seekbar

Task 1 “About Me” Fragment- 
This fragment will be the requirement for all future homework. In this fragment, you need to show the following information:
 Your full name
 The class session that you belong to (e.g. CIS 400 or CSE 691, etc.)
 Your picture
You can customize how it looks. Since this fragment will be used again and again in future homework, it is a good idea to make it look nice. You can also improve it in future homework, after you have learned more about UI.

Task 2 LinearLayout Fragment-
In this fragment, you need to build the layout shown in Figure 1. You can only use LinearLayout. Note, the labels on the button should also be like what are shown in the figure, because their lengths are intentionally made different.

Task 3 RelativeLayout Fragment-
In this fragment, you need to build the layout shown in Figure 2. You can only use RelativeLayout.

Task 4 GridLayout Fragment-
In this fragment, you need to use GridLayout to construct the layouts shown in Figure 3. You don’t need to use the same pictures (choose your own). When the phone is in the portrait mode, it uses the layout on the left side; when it is in the landscape mode, it uses the layout on the right side.

Task 5 Displaying Movie Data-
In this fragment, you need to display the movie information from the files provided by us, including MovieData.java and many movie images. Your fragment will have at least a Button. When the user clicks the button (labeled “Load Next Movie”), the data of another movie will be loaded and displayed within the same fragment. Our movie data contain many fields, and you should display at least the following information:
 Title
 Description
 Image
 Year
 Stars
 Rating (Don’t use TextView here; find the most suitable UI widget to display this information)
You are responsible for designing the layout of this fragment. Make it look nice. The 15 points on “look and feel” will mostly be used in here. This layout will be reused in future homework, so make sure you don’t keep losing the “look and feel” points, even if you can’t get all of it at the first time.

Task 6 SeekBar-
In this fragment, you need to have a SeekBar and an ImageView. The ImageView can display an image of your choice. The mark of the SeekBar should be placed in the middle initially. You need to do the followings:
 When the user slides the SeekBar, the size of the image should change accordingly.
 When the user long-presses the image, the mark of the SeekBar goes to the middle (i.e., the initial position), and the size of the image should change accordingly.
